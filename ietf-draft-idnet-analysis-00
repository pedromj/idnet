        A General Considerations of Intelligence Driven Network
                        draft-idnet-analysis-00

Abstract

   This document aims to pinpoint the work scope of Intelligence Driven
   Network (IDN) and mine the potential standardization work.  Firstly,
   the problems and new requirements for the existing methods are
   analyzed.  Numbers of high value use-cases are proposed as examples
   to instantiate them.  A benchmark framework design is proposed, which
   is important during the machine learning and inference process.
   Finally, a reference model of IDN is proposed, based on which the
   potential standardization work is analyzed.

   work and what should not.  Clarify the work boundary. (e.g. in my
   personal opinion, the pure algorithm research will not be suitable

   for our IETF works since it is not relative with protocols and
   communications.  Also, the architecture work will be not suitable.
   But we need one, such as the one discussed at IETF-99, for
   reference.)

2.2.  High Value Use Cases

   The descriptions for various use cases, which we have some
   aggregation in the mail list.  Describe the scenarios that may be
   useful and valuable.  A details analysis may be helpful for the data
   and protocol design.

2.2.1.  Traffic Prediction

   Collect the history traffic data and external data which may
   influence the traffic.  Predict the traffic in short/long/specific
   term.  Avoid the congestion or risk in previously.

   The process, data format and message needs are:

   Process: 1.  Data collection (e.g. traffic sample of physical/logical
   port ); 2.  Training Model; 3.  Real-time data capture and input; 4.
   Predication output; 5.  Fix error and go back to 3.

   Data Format:

      Time : [Start, End, Unit, Number of Value, Sampling Period]

      Position: [Device ID, Port ID]

      Direction: IN / OUT

      Route : [R1, R2, ..., RN] (might be useful for some scenarios)

      Service : [Service ID, Priority, ...] (Not clear how to use it but
      seems useful)

      Traffic: [T0, T1, T2, ..., TN]

2.2.2.  QoS management

   It is worthy to predict the traffic change for avoiding the
   congestion and ensuring QoS.  As the following figure shown, the AI
   system continuously collects link status data from the network.  This
   AI system is responsible for two things.  One is monitoring and
   predicting the traffic on each link and the other one is calculating
   the usable route for any pair of nodes according to the prediction
   and current link status.  Assume that there is a VPN named VPN_S_D
   from node S to D which pass through S-A-B-C-D.  According to the
   prediction, there will be a huge traffic flow from node A to C in the
   future 10 min.  The traffic will increase the end-to-end delay from S
   to D so that the QoS will not be ensured.

                x     x
          _ A ---- B ---- C._      link status   +----------+
        ,'    \        /      `.   =============>|IDN Engine|
      -'        \    /          `-               +----------+
    S ------I ---- J ----  K ----  D
      .          /   \          ,'
       `.      /       \      ,'
         '  O ---- P ----  Q '

   There are at least two solutions. one is modifying the object's
   configuration to avoid the potential congestion.  For example, we
   modify the VPN_S_D route from S-A-B-C-D to S-I-J-K-D.  The other one
   is restricting non-object's transmission so that to protect the
   object's QoS.  For example, we increase the reserved bandwidth of
   VPN_S_D or modify the route of non-object flows from S-A-B-C-D to
   S-I-J-K-D therefore most of the traffic will not affect VPN_S_D.

   Here we may have some challenges.  Challenge 1 is the AI prediction
   and autonomic decision should be a quick response.  The whole process
   must be finished before the congestion happens meanwhile the AI
   system is meaningless.  The question is how to implement such quick
   response?  Challenge 2 is whether there is existing protocols which
   can support high frequency measurement?  Because AI system needs to
   be fed with continuous link status data.  And the real-time data need
   to be captured frequently otherwise the route change will be
   worthless.  I think the protocols that support high frequency
   measurement and data collection may become one of our focus point.

   The process, data format and message needs are:

   Process: 1.  Data capture (e.g. traffic sample of physical/logical
   port ); 2.  Training Model; 3.  Real-time data capture and input; 4.
   Output percentages; 5.  Fix error and go back to 3.

4.  Benchmarking Framework

   A standard benchmarking framework is required to assess the quality
   of an AI mechanism when it is used to resolve a specific problem in
   the network maangement and control area.  It comprises a reference
   set of procedures, methods, models, and boundary values that *must*
   be enforced to the benchmarked mechanism, so that its operation can
   be comparable to other mechanisms and users can easily understand
   what to expect from each one.

   Moreover, both the metrics included as a reference within the
   benchmarking framework and the results obtained from its application
   to a new mechanism must follow a standard format.  Therefore, the
   standard formats must be enforced to all data, either being
   introduced to the benchmarking application or system (consumed), or
   obtained from its application (produced).

   A common and decentralized "data market" can (and would) arise from
   the inclusion, dependency, and the general relation of all data,
   considering it is represented using the same concepts (ontology) and
   the standard format mentioned here.  As a reference, it is worth to
   mention that a similar appraoch has been alreday applied to genome
   and protein data to build standardized and easily transferable data
   banks [PMJ1][PMJ2] [PMJ3], and they have demonstrated to be key
   enablers in their respective work areas.

   The initial scope of input/output data would be the datasets, but
   also the new knowledge items that are stated as a result of applying
   the benchmarking procedures defined by the framework, which can be
   collected together to build a database of benchmark results, or just
   contrasted with other existing entries in the database to know the
   position of the solution just evaluated.  This increases the
   usefulness of IDNET.

5.  References Model and Potential Standardization Points

   TBD

5.1.  References Model

   A three layers reference model of IDN has been proposed as follow.
   This architecture can cover, explain and support most of the current
   use cases and scenarios.

   The under layer is Infrastructure layer, which contains network
   function, measurement function and terminal/user device.  The network
   function stands for the traditional routers, switches and other

   foundations and forwarding data.  The Measurement function stands for
   devices that can collect information from the network and various
   devices.  A popular option are probe system, which is deployed
   distributed among the network.  Besides that, some of the network
   devices integrate the measure function and play two roles.  The
   information may involve but not limited the content listed in
   following table.  The Terminal/User Device stands for the device that
   produces and consumes data, which may include PC, smart phone,
   datacenter, content storage server, cloud and etc.  Some of the data
   produced by terminal/user devices is measurable.  This type of data
   will be captured by the measurement function.  Other types of data
   that cannot be measured directly by network measurement functions is

   the future via 3rd party integration at the intelligence layer.

   The middle layer is Control Layer, which contains Control Function,
   Dataset Aggregation (Function) and 3rd Party Dataset.  The control
   function stands for entities that can control, configure and operate
   devices, especially network devices.  In SDN, controller and
   orchestrator are control functions.  Classical network devices such
   as routers integrate the forwarding and control functions (although
   as of today not with many instances of intelligent control
   functions).  Classical routers therefore include functions from two
   layers.  We foresee that the control function will most likely only
   perform intelligent inference, but not learn.  For example, to
   execute neural networks, but do not train them.  This is only an
   assumption at this time though and may prove to be wrong in the
   future when training becomes something easier defined into the
   control layer.

   The aggregated dataset function owns the ability to gather and tidy
   the data.  The database or database cluster is the typical example.
   Some of the control devices, such as SDN controller, integrate this
   function.  Distributed instances aggregate data have also been
   defined.  The network data can be directly sent back to the control
   function in support of network policies.  For example, the controller
   can adjust the flow table according to the local cache which collects
   the network data periodically from the devices in its controlled
   area.  The 3rd party dataset involves the data that may be provided
   by all kinds of applications or services.  For example, the content
   provider may own social contact data and the map service provider may
   own the geographic data.  This information does not belong to the
   network but could be very helpful for intelligent analytics and
   decision making in the network - which is why we device in the
   architecture the ability to communicate it between 3rd parties and
   the network.

   The high layer, which is also the main body of IDN, is the
   Intelligence Layer.  This layer is commonly deployed in the
   datacenter, or large scale computing centre that can support massive
   storage and computing resources.  To the south direction, there are
   two interfaces which provides external data (3rd party data oriented)
   and internal data (network data oriented) access.  We define a data
   refiner component to emphasize the need to adopt format and structure
   of various types of collected information to the needs of the IDN
   Engine.

   The core of the IDN Engine are algorithm and model.  The IDN Engine
   can be built based on the result of the large body of research and
   platform development work that already exists (albeit mostly
   developed for and deployed with non-network data).  The platform
   should be agile extensible for future services, therefore we define a
   3rd party Algorithm Interface to provide an adaptive developing
   ability.  The user (or a 3rd party) may develop his/her own
   algorithms and upload then onto the IDN Engine via a northbound Open
   Application Interface.  Additional Northbound Open Application
   interfaces can also be used to connect other software platforms to
   the IDN Engine to create a cooperation between multiple systems (not
   shown).

   The output of IDN Engine is transmitted to the Policy Generator.
   Since the policy language might be machine readable or unreadable,
   the Policy Generator is responsible for generating the executable
   commands and connect to the control devices.  This process refers to
   the interactions of northbound interface of control devices - which
   is what often gets standardized.  Therefore, some of the potential
   standardization points will be mentioned in the following.

5.2.  Measurement

   In IDN, the intelligent system (or database) needs frequent and
   repeat measurement to obtain the link information.  A fast measure
   and feedback protocol is needed to meet the requirement of
   measurement and data collecting.  It may be based on SNMP or an
   absolutely new protocol.  The intelligent system needs massive data
   to feed and support to formulate the policy and decision.  Therefore,
   the measurement must be satisfy the data requirement of IDN.
   Firstly, there may be higher-level requirement for the existing
   measuring technology.  The high timeliness is one of the potential
   point.  The IDN's control function needs accurate, global and highly
   real-time network data support.  The current measure technology can
   only satisfy at least two characters of the three.  Secondly, the IDN
   may need more kinds of data type to measure.  Not only the delay,
   jitter and packet loss rate, but also the link utilization and other
   necessary parameters.

5.3.  ata representation, transport and aggregation

   The data representation is significant.  Most of the current AI
   algorithms were born in the pattern recognition area, especially the
   image processing.  The advantage of these algorithms is that they are
   very good at dealing with complex problems, especially mining and
   modeling the hidden relationship among the non-semantic data.  One of
   the disadvantages is that almost all the algorithms require the
   training data has a high concordance.  Fortunately, the image file
   instinctively owns this character.  All the images can be expressed
   as uniform binary vectors or can be easily transformed into uniform
   format.  But this condition is hardly satisfied in network area.

   A uniform data format is required, which can implement the
   justification, correlation and affiliation of the data.  Which may
   obtain the best performance of AI algorithm to mine the valid pattern
   hidden in the data.  Since the intelligent system is data-driven, and
   the data resources are from different kind of vendors and device
   types, the data representation SHALL be consistent so that the
   intelligent system could merge the data and do the analysis/learning.
   Also, the data collection interface might also need to be
   standardized so that the interface is able to get the data the
   intelligent system needs.

   Moreover, it is significant to standard the policy representation.
   Since there may multiply SDN controller system, a readable and
   uniform policy representation is valuable to improve the policy
   deploying efficiency and simplify the communication between
   controllers on the East-West direction.

5.4.  Legacy Device Route control

   Similar with IPv4/IPv6 transition, the IDN potentially faces to the
   legacy problem, which means that the new devices and functions will
   co-work with the legacy devices.  Therefore, it is potentially
